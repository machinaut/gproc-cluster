Tools for setting up a little toy gproc cluster to play with

Steps to setup your own
=======================

First step is you're gonna need a copy of the linux-0.2.img. google for it, then put it in util/

Once you got that clone the base image into directories numbered 0 through 7.
Lucky for you, I made a script to do this. Just run:

 $ ./makeclones.sh

Then you need to start all of the virtual machines

 $ ./launchclones.sh

And since they're all running VNC for display, how about connect to all of
their VNC servers.

 $ ./connectclones.sh

Then when you're done and want to get rid of them, delete all the nodes

 $ ./cleanclones.sh
